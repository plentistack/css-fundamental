    <h1>CSS Layout Techniques Demo</h1>

    <h2>Floats: Aligning Elements Side by Side</h2>
    <p>Floats allow you to align elements, such as images or navigation bars, to the left or right, making text wrap around them. For example, you can use 'float: right' to align an image to the right.</p>

    <img class="float-example" src="https://plentistack.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/css-fundamental-03-1024x1024.webp" alt="Floating Image">
    <p>Here's an example of an image floating to the right, with text wrapping around its left side.</p>

    <h2>Positioning: Precise Element Placement</h2>
    <p>Positioning properties give you control over the exact placement of elements. You can use values like 'static,' 'relative,' 'absolute,' 'fixed,' and 'sticky' to position elements with precision.</p>

    <div class="position-example">Positioned Element</div>
    <p>In this practical example, we've used 'position: absolute' to position a div 50px from the top and 20px from the right within its containing element.</p>

    <h2>Flexbox: Flexible Layouts</h2>
    <p>Flexbox, or the Flexible Box Layout Module, simplifies creating responsive layouts. By using 'display: flex' on a container, its children are automatically arranged in a row. 'justify-content' helps evenly distribute these children within the container.</p>

    <div class="flex-container">
        <div class="flex-item">Item 1</div>
        <div class="flex-item">Item 2</div>
        <div class="flex-item">Item 3</div>
    </div>

    <h2>Choosing the Right Technique</h2>
    <p>Your choice between floats, positioning, and flexbox depends on your specific layout needs. Floats work well for basic column-based layouts, positioning offers precise control but is more complex, while flexbox is ideal for modern, responsive designs, simplifying layout challenges.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>CSS layout techniques, including floats, positioning, and flexbox, are essential tools for web developers and designers. Mastering these techniques allows you to create sophisticated, responsive, and visually pleasing web layouts.
